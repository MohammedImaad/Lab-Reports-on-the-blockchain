This application is built using Node Js. And Express Js. as they complement each other
and also work hand in hand. Express Js. build on top of Node Js. making the combination
a lightweight framework which makes making API calls, request handling and building
the frontend extremely convienient. The app uses HTML and CSS to build the frontend,
making the UI/UX experience ideal. The Smart Contract was built using the Remix IDE
which on storing the medical records give a unique address which can be used by the
user to access his/her medical records. Right now, the application only stores the blood
group and blood sugar levels. Another additional feature of this application is that it
provides a medicine search engine. The document also provides a feature where the
user can enter the name of the medicine and it displays the active ingredients, purpose
and any necessary warnings. This feature I believe cold be beneficial to both doctors and
patients helping them know more about the medicine theyâ€™re consuming. The
application makes calls to the FDA API to access information on medicines and displays
them. Overall, this application aims to promote transparency in the medical industry and
also making information on medicines more accessible and also helping in the
administrative side of things reducing the burden of the staff by leveraging the powerful
technology of Blockchain.
